# Data Analysis of Apple Watch Fitness Data

This project showcases my skills in data analysis and visualization using real-world data from my Apple Watch. The dataset includes step count, distance, energy burned, flights climbed, walking double support percentage, and walking speed, collected over several days.

## Data Source

The data was collected from an Apple Watch and exported as a CSV file. The file contains several columns of data, including date, time, step count, distance, energy burned, flights climbed, walking double support percentage, and walking speed.

## Data Analysis

I used Python and several libraries, including pandas, plotly.graph_objs, plotly.express, and plotly.subplots, to analyze the data. The analysis includes several visualizations, such as step count over time, distance vs. energy burned, flights climbed, walking speed distribution, and walking double support percentage. These visualizations provide insights into the user's fitness habits and help identify trends and patterns in the data.

## Interactive Dashboard

I combined the visualizations into an interactive dashboard using Dash, a Python framework for building web applications.The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the data and gaining insights into the user's fitness habits.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my expertise in data analysis and visualization, as well as my ability to apply these skills to real-world data.
